I developed an android game about ten years ago named Slide-Puzzle.

You can create a puzzle for your friends or solve your friend's puzzles.

Create a puzzle and share the puzzle image with your friends to solve (data of the correct puzzle is stored inside a QR code at the bottom of the shared photo)

### The game has two modes:
1. Select two images for position replacement
2. Sliding mode

### Game features:
* Timer
* Move counts
* Original photo view
